this is just clarification, to understand HER better:

Core Principle of HER (Always the Same):
HER takes a failed trajectory (where the agent didn‚Äôt reach its original goal) and pretends it tried to reach a different goal (usually one it actually achieved later), and recomputes the reward accordingly.

This principle doesn‚Äôt change.

How This Helps Learning
Instead of throwing away "failed" experiences (where the agent didn‚Äôt reach the original goal), we say:

"What if the actual place the agent ended up was the goal all along?"

This allows the agent to learn what actions lead to achieving some goal ‚Äî and generalize from that.

What Can Change Based on the Environment?
-----------------------------------------
1. Reward Function
-------------------
Each environment defines what counts as a "success".

So HER needs to call:
env.compute_reward(achieved_goal, desired_goal, info)
This function must be customized per environment ‚Äî and HER uses it to recompute the reward after changing the goal.

Example difference:
In FetchReach-v1, success = end-effector within 0.05 meters of target.
In FetchPush-v1, success = object pushed to target location.
-> HER needs to use the right reward function for each.

2. Goal & Observation Structure
-------------------------------
Different environments may return observations like:
{
  'observation': np.array([...]),       # robot state, object position, etc.
  'achieved_goal': np.array([...]),     # where the robot (or object) ended up
  'desired_goal': np.array([...]),      # the target position
}
HER depends on this structure.
If your environment doesn‚Äôt use this structure, you‚Äôd need to adapt HER accordingly.

3. Episode Length (Timestep Limit)
----------------------------------
The way HER samples future goals ‚Äî like future_t = t + random offset ‚Äî depends on episode length T.
Some environments might have longer or shorter episodes, so HER must respect those boundaries.

4. HER Strategy (You Choose)
----------------------------
Some environments benefit more from different HER strategies:

Strategy-Description
final: Use the last achieved goal in the episode
future:	Use a randomly sampled future achieved goal
episode:	Use a random achieved goal from the same episode
random:	Use a goal from any experience in the buffer
You choose the strategy depending on the environment's difficulty and success rate.

Our Example: FetchPush-v4
The environment FetchPush-v4 (from Gymnasium Robotics) is: 
- Goal-conditioned
- Observation is a dict with observation, achieved_goal, desired_goal
- Has env.compute_reward() function
- follows Gym's goal-based observation format ‚Äî so standard HER works great.

BUT if you move to a custom or sparse-reward environment that:

- doesn't expose achieved_goal
- has dense rewards
- lacks compute_reward
‚Üí HER must be adapted or may not apply at all.

Does HER class depend on the environment?

| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

ToDo: This is a simplified HER reward computation. It will not match the actual env.compute_reward() used by FetchPush-v4, which checks object distance to the goal.
It works but it hardcodes the reward as 0 for success and -1 otherwise
in if i == num_transitions-1:
  reward = 0
else:
  reward = -1
This hardcoded logic guesses whether a transition was successful based purely on its position in the episode. It doesn't actually check whether the goal was achieved. This is a simplified HER reward computation. It will not match the actual env.compute_reward() used by FetchPush-v4, which checks object distance to the goal.

########
what i replace it with: 
reward = self.reward_fn(hind_experiences['ag_next'][i], hind_experiences['g'][i], None)
ask the environment:
‚ÄúGiven that the agent achieved this position, and the goal is this new (fake) goal, what would the actual reward be?‚Äù
What Is Being Passed Here?
hind_experiences['ag_next'][i]:
‚Üí the achieved goal at timestep i + 1 (i.e., where the agent or object ended up)

hind_experiences['g'][i]:
‚Üí the desired goal (possibly changed by HER to a new goal)

None:
‚Üí a placeholder for info, which some environments require but ignore

maybe replace with: reward = self.reward_fn(hind_experiences['ag_next'][i], hind_experiences['g'][i], None)

In FetchPush-v4, This Calls:
env.compute_reward(achieved_goal, desired_goal, info)
Which returns:
- 0.0 if the object is within a small radius (like 0.05m) of the goal
- -1.0 otherwise
So it accurately reflects success or failure, based on actual positions.


What This Achieves
| With hardcoded `0/-1` logic                                  | With `reward_fn(...)`                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assumes only the last step could be a success                | Checks **every step** to see if the **new goal was met**         |
| Doesn't account for agent actually reaching the goal earlier | Can reward *any* successful transition                           |
| Not adaptable across environments                            | Works with any goal-based env that implements `compute_reward()` |

| Step | `achieved_goal`    | `new_goal`       | Result           |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 0    | \[0.2, 0.3, 0.5]   | \[1.0, 1.0, 0.5] | Too far ‚Üí -1     |
| 1    | \[0.6, 0.7, 0.5]   | \[1.0, 1.0, 0.5] | Still far ‚Üí -1   |
| 2    | \[1.01, 1.02, 0.5] | \[1.0, 1.0, 0.5] | Close enough ‚Üí 0 |

Only step 2 is a success, so reward_fn(...) gives accurate feedback.

Replacing the hardcoded reward logic with:

reward = self.reward_fn(hind_experiences['ag_next'][i], hind_experiences['g'][i], None)
achieves this:

- Accurate, environment-specific reward recalculation
- Real detection of success/failure based on positions
- Generalizes across any goal-based environment
